  ## Description:  
  For this homework assignment, we had to complete a hosted web-app using the MVC concept. To implement, I had to utilie the mysql, express, and express handlebars npms. The app's functionality must all users to add a new type of burger. When a new burger is created, the burger defaults to the left side of the screen, which is a list of burgers that have not been eaten. Each burger in this section also has a button that allows the user to indicate that the burger has been devoured. Once they click this button the burger is then moved to the right side of the page which contains the list of devoured burgers.
